        <p>Hi, my name is Ryan Yi and I'm an undergraduate computer science student at James Madison University.</p>
        <p>I was born and raised in Northern Virginia, and have always had a passion for most/any subjects involving
            computers. Being on the computer since I was young, it has become a comfortable place for me to express both
            my interests, and do activities that make me happy
            like playing video games, watching videos, or talking
            with my friends. In my free time I enjoy trying to learn golf, playing video games, working out, or watching
            a new show. As for my interests in computer science, I enjoy learning about software development, and the
            process
            involved with it. For my career path, however, I'm still researching and learning about what I'd like to do.
